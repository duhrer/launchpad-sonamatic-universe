        <h3>Welcome to the Launchpad Sonamatic Universe</h3>

        <!-- TODO: Move this to a "help" or "about" block once we have a component for that? -->

        <p>
            This project presents a range of experiences inspired by and designed for the Novation Launchpad.  You can
            try most of them with just a compatible browser (at time of writing, only Chrome and derivatives, such as
            Edge, Opera, and Brave).  Many of these experiences do not produce sound on their own, but require you to
            connect an external MIDI device or software solution.
        </p>

        <p>
            For the best experience, a Novation Launchpad is recommended.  A compatible Launchpad controller can operate
            most of these experiences.  In most cases, the lights of the Launchpad also form part of the user interface.
        </p>

        <p>
            These experiences are well tested on the original Launchpad Pro (sometimes referred to as the "Mark Two") as
            well as the Launchpad Pro 3. There is also limited support for the original Launchpad (with the Ableton
            badge in the corner).   If you have another model of Launchpad and would like to help add support, please
            <a href="https://github.com/duhrer/launchpad-sonamatic-universe/issues">create an issue</a> to talk through
            the details.
        </p>

        <h3>Choose a Journey</h3>

        <h4><a href="./src/html/onscreen.html">"Onscreen" UI</a></h4>

        <p>
            A demonstration of an "onscreen" version of the Launchpad that generates and responds to (most of) the same
            MIDI messages. Requires an external MIDI device to produce sound.
        </p>

        <h4><a href="./src/html/aftertouch.html">"Aftertouch"</a></h4>

        <p>
            Visualise aftertouch by lighting the pads surrounding played notes. Requires an external MIDI device to
            produce sound.
        </p>

        <h4><a href="./src/html/fretboard.html">"Fretboard"</a></h4>

        <p>
            An alternate tuning for the launchpad that emulates a guitar fretboard.  Can be used with multiple units
            to create a single large virtual fretboard. Requires an external MIDI device to produce sound.
        </p>

        <h4><a href="./src/html/polarVortex.html">"Polar Vortex"</a></h4>

        <p>
            A playable vortex with (configurable) gravity and rotation.  Pads are held to input energy, which results
            in swirls of lights and notes.  Does not require an external MIDI device to produce sound.
