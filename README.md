# Launchpad Sonamatic Universe

This repository contains a collection of web applications that are designed to be experienced with Novation Launchpad
grid controllers.

## Prerequisites

You need a supported browser to run the applications provided by this package.  All applications in this package rely on
the [Web MIDI API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_MIDI_API).  At the moment, this is only
supported in Chrome and derivatives (such as Opera and Edge).

The applications in this repository are best experienced with a supported Novation Launchpad grid controller. Currently,
the following are supported:

- Launchpad Pro (original version)
- Launchpad Pro (MK3)
- Launchpad (original version)

 If you don't have a supported controller, in most cases an onscreen equivalent of the Launchpad is available.  This can
 be controlled using your keyboard and/or mouse.

## Try It Yourself

A deployed copy of the examples in this package can be found
[on my GitHub Pages site](https://duhrer.github.io/demos/launchpad-sonamatic-universe/).

To try it yourself locally:

1. Install all dependencies using a command like `npm install`.
2. Open the file `index.html` in the root of the repository in your browser.
